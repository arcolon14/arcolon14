# Angel G. Rivera-Colón

I am a postdoc in the [Kern-Ralph co-lab](https://kr-colab.github.io/) in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon. I am currently working on population genomics in barnacles and venturing into the world of population genomic simulations.

During my PhD in [Julian Catchen's lab](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolution, Univertsity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my main project was on comparative and population genomics of Antarctic icefish. I also worked on the development and implementation of bioinformatic tools for the analysis of RADseq data, including the [Stacks](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and [RADinitio](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/radinitio/) software.

In addition to this GitHub page, you can find out more about work my [Bitbucket workspace](https://bitbucket.org/angelgr2/) and [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7yec5K8AAAAJ&hl=en).

You can also find me on social media on Twitter/X ([@arcolon14](https://twitter.com/arcolon14)) and BlueSky ([arcolon14.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/arcolon14.bsky.social)).
